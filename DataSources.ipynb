    "2.  Date data was collected is on a major religious holiday that coincides with spikes in travel and therefore would skew availability data \n",
    "3.  Since the data was around a religious holiday, it is likely to represent travel to homes/family, not necessarily travel for pleasure, therefore skewing data away from \"popular\" neighborhoods.\n",

    "1.  September 11, 2001 was a major event in American history.  Because of this disaster there would've been a significant apike in mental health services, certainly in NY but also other major cities.\n",
